/*
value returned from main function is considered as exitCode.
0 = successful termination of your application.
other than 0, there are chances that the application exited due to some error. (the developer might create some documentation of
the meaning of the exitCode returning by the application)
main function by default it is returning 0 when the return type is int
main function should return int or void. This is because, when we want to return anything, the return value is captured by the OS.
