/*
Given an int array, a developer would like to fill array with integers.
The strategy for filling array would be anything.
For instance, prime num, odd nos, etc. This is unpredictible.
Developer wants to write a 'fill' function such that it will take array to be filled as one argument and strategy as second argument.
The 'fill' function should invoke the respective strategy algorithm that it will populate values of the array's element values.
Assume, if you are the developer, how will you write 'fill' ?
